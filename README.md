# Wave Function Collapse

## Description

This is a JavaScript implementation of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm. The algorithm is used to generate terrain based on patterns identified from a single input image.

## Purpose

Ultimately, my hope for this project is that it would facilitate easy map creation for game devs, where they wouldn't need to spend time hardcoding tile connection rules, and can simply supply an input image that fits their expectations. Further, the **tile rules** themselves could be exported and used for proceedurally generated maps.

Here are some more specific ideas that support the statement above:

- A game mechanic where the world is created slowly as you progress and in clear view of the player. The player can influence WHICH cells collapse.
- A open-world 2D game (like Terraria, but with very different terrain) that is procedurally generated using WFC (off screen, so players can't see world being made).
  - An input image would be run through this WFC demo. This would provide tile rules for a WFC engine built within the game, such as the one [here](https://github.com/NathanHinthorne/WFC-Engine).
  - World would be generated in chunks, with a "stitching" algorithm that ensures chunks connect properly. This would avoid restarts caused by backtracking and would provide the opportunity to run WFC in parallel.
  - WFC would be used to generate the **basic terrain**, but another algorithm with simple randomization could add **variation** by swapping these out with appropriate tile variations. This technique would be used for things like trees, rocks, or other decorations that are placed on the terrain.

## Algorithm

The algorithm works in the following way:

1. Takes in an input image and breaks it down into tiles.

2. Identifies the unique tiles, known as **tile variants** and gives each tile variant a unique ID.

3. Analyzes how the tiles are placed in relation to each other, creating a list of **adjacency rules** and **frequency hints**.

    a. **Adjacency rules** describe which tiles may appear next to other tiles in each cardinal direction (the possible neighboring tiles).

    b. **Frequency hints** are a mapping from each tile to a number indicating how frequently the tile should appear in the output, relative to other tiles.

4. Creates a grid of cells for the output.

5. Populates the grid by collapsing cells into tiles in a way which *completely* respects **adjacency rules**, and *probabilistically* respects **frequency hints**.

    a. The propagation of tiles is done by choosing the cell with the lowest entropy (the cell with the fewest tile options), then collapsing it into a single tile. This process is repeated until the grid is filled.

For a more detailed explanation how the algorithm works, you may read [this paper I wrote on the subject.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-WoEQ621dulmirr-kJOZsOoEZSxZ8T0e/view?usp=sharing)

## Plans

- Finish a basic implementation of WFC:
  - [x] Parse input image to collect unique tiles
  - [x] Create adjacency rules from connected tiles
  - [x] Create frequency hints from connected tiles
  - [x] Let adjacency rules play a role in tile selection
  - [x] Let frequency hints play a role in tile selection
  - [x] Create a simple GUI for the user to adjust algorithm parameters

- Tweak algorithm propagation rules to achieve better output:

  - [x] For edge tiles analyzed in the input grid, because some of their neighbors don't exist, let the **most common** tile found in the input grid be the only tile that can be placed next to the edge tile. Best case scenario, the most common tile is "air" or "empty" so it will probably fit well.
  
  - [x] Implement a "backtracking" feature that allows the algorithm to backtrack and try a different tile if it gets stuck (i.e. no tiles can be placed in a cell). Utilize use a stack of previous states to accomplish this.
  
  - [x] Implement Shannon Entropy as a more accurate form of entropy. Shannon Entropy accounts for weighted probabilities of tiles. (note: Shannon Entropy was attempted but resulted in less accurate output. See paper linked above for more details.)
  
  - [x] Have **tile clusters** (composed of 3x3 tiles) which have their own local constraints relative to other nearby tile clusters. This facilitates the formation of larger patterns in the output image. One way to think of this is that it gives each cell the ability to "see" farther away than just its immediate neighbors before collapsing. This is different than having distant neighbors because tile clusters don't care about DIRECTION (i.e. they won't cause a cell to be constrained to a specific tile in a specific direction). Instead, they care about the tile itself and its frequency in the cluster. This fixes the issue where generated ground tiles don't leave room for player to move. For cave generation, this helps tunnels connect.
    - Cons:
      - Computationally expensive.
      - Can cause a snowballing effect where the same tile gets put everywhere.
      - Might limit the diversity of patterns in the output image,
    - NOTE: I ended up fully implementing this idea on the `tile-clusters` branch.
  
  - [x] If the tile cluster idea fails, try adding **distant neighbors** which are neighbor tiles that are 2 spaces away instead of 1. These distant neighbors will have less influence (carry less weight) than immediate neighbors. This approach accomplishes *nearly* the same goal as tile clusters, but is easier to code and has a higher likelyhood of success.
    - Cons:
      - Cares too much about the direction of previously placed tiles (i.e. a cell might be constrained to a specific tile in a specific direction). This could be helpful is some circumstances, but most of the time we simply want to clump similar tiles together. NOTE: This should be possible to fix by simply lumping all distant neighbors from all directions into a single map of frequency hints.
    - NOTE: I ended up fully implementing this idea on the `distant-neighbors` branch.

  - [ ] To eliminate unfavorable randomess, try passing along `limit` parameters in addition to frequency hints. These limits would be decremented each time a cell collapses into the tile. This prevents WFC from going hog wild with certain tiles.

  - [ ] To use a technique that's proven to work for generating natural terrain, try implementing an overlapping model of WFC.
  
  - [x] Since this version of WFC is geared towards terrain generation, it's probably okay to add some global contraints in addition to the local constraints that already exist between tile variants. Therefore, let the user specify a **behavior** for any tile variant they choose (e.g. "floor" and "empty"). Ensure these categories have global constraints that must be followed. For example:
  
    - **floor** tiles must be connected to the bottom row of the output.
  
    - **empty** tiles are artifically added as neighbors to the edge tiles.

- Perform analysis on different implementations of WFC to see how they affect the output:

  - [x] Setup a way to gather appropriate data for different implementations, like operation counts or running time, and plot these results in an appropriate way (e.g. a line graph).
  
  - [x] Test Shannon entropy vs rough entropy (entropy that's not weighted by tile frequency)

- [x] Create a button to export the tile connection rules so they can be used in a game engine.

:warning: **TIPS**

Keep in mind that if you want the algorithm to pick up patterns between tiles, ensure you have some **duplicate tiles** in the image (i.e. tiles composed of the exact same pixels).

Also, please be aware that your input image size might be too small for the algorithm to generate realistic terrain. With a larger sample size, the algorithm produces better tile connection rules, which results in output images that are closer to your expectations.
